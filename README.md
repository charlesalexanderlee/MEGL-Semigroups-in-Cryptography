## Abstract
Groups form an integral part of many cryptographic systems; mainly due to the presence of inverse elements that facilitate secure encryption and decryption processes. This project first explores the role of group theory in established cryptographic methods, such as RSA Public Key Encryption. Changing tack, we then examine semigroups (non-empty sets equipped with an associative binary operation) as alternative algebraic structures for cryptography. In doing so, we analyse how the lack of inverse elements, and potentially the absence of an identity element, impacts the design and security of the encryption methods that are possible. Students are encouraged to apply these concepts creatively by developing and assessing their own cryptographic systems using semigroups.
